# Ceasar Cipher

**Author**: Joseph Hangarter
**Version**: 1.0.0

## Overview
* Create an encrypt function that takes in a plain text phrase and a numeric key.
* Create a decrypt method that takes in encrypted text and numeric key which will restore the encrypted text back to its original form as long as correct key is supplied.
* Break the code so that an encrypted message can be transformed into its original state without access to the key.
* Devise a method for the computer to determine if code was broken with minimal human guidance.
* NOTE: In order to accomplish this task youâ€™ll need access to a corpus of English words.
    * A search on something like python list of english words should get you going.
## Getting Started
* run `pipenv shell`
